## Class version

This file contains all methods of recommender systems in the form of class, which is easier to understand and user.

The following files contain the class version of each recommender systems:

- **Item_based_recommender**: This file contains the class version of item-based recommender system and a pseudocode of the algorithm.

- **kNN_hybrid_based_recommender**: This file contains the class version of kNN-hybrid recommender system and a pseudocode of the algorithm.

- **Matrix_factorization_based_recommender**: This file contains the class version of matrix factorization recommender system and a pseudocode of the algorithm.

- **Neuronal_colaborative_filter_based_recommender**: This file contains the class version of neuronal collaborative filter recommender system and a pseudocode of the algorithm.

- **Trivial_based_recommender**: This file contains the class version of trivial recommender system and a pseudocode of the algorithm.

- **User_based_recommender**: This file contains the class version of user-based recommender system and a pseudocode of the algorithm.

To execute the script, it's necessary get into the directory of the file and run the following command:

```
python3 script_name.py
```

For example, to execute the Trivial_based_recommender, run the following command:

```
python3 trivial_based_recommender.py
```
