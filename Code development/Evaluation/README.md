## Evaluation

In this file, we will examine the results obtained by the different models and compare them. We will also generate graphs for the results obtained to visualize the accuracy of the models, and this graphs will stores in the folder `Images`.

The following scripts will generate the differents graphs for the results obtained:

- **`evaluation.py`**: This script will generate the graphs for the results obtained of differents models and compare them.

- **`mf_evaluation.py`**: This script will generate the graphs for the results obtained of differents configurations of parameters of the Matrix Factorization model. And compare them to obtain the best configuration for the model.

- **`ncf_evaluation.py`**: This script will generate the graphs for the results obtained of differents configurations of parameters of the Neural Collaborative Filtering model. And compare them to obtain the best configuration for the model.

To execute the scripts, you can use the following command:

```
python evaluation.py
```
