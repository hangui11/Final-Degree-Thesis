## Methods version

In this folder, you can find the code developed for the methods version of the all implemented models. This methods are the first version of the recommender system models, so will have some limitations on precision and performance compared to the class version. You can find the following files:

- **Item_based_recommender**: This file contains the code for the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm used in the recommender system.

- **kNN_hybrid_based_recommneder**: This file contains the code for the hybrid based on k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm used in the recommender system.

- **Matrix_factorization_based_recommender**: This file contains the code for the matrix factorization algorithm used in the recommender system.

- **Neuronal_colaborative_filter_based_recommender**: This file contains the code for the neuronal collaborative filtering algorithm used in the recommender system.

- **Trivial_based_recommender**: This file contains the code for the trivial algorithm used in the recommender system.

- **User_based_recommender**: This file contains the code for the user-based collaborative filtering algorithm used in the recommender system.

To execute the script, it's necessary get into the folder and run the script with Python. 
```
python3 script_name.py
```

For example, to execute the Item-based recommender, you can run the following command:
```
python3 item_based_recommender.py
```
