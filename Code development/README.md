## Code development
In this section, you could find the differents algorithms and techniques used to develop the recommender system models and results obtained from them.

This section contains the following files and scripts:

- **Class version**: This file contains the class version of the recommender system models.

- **Evaluation**: This file contains the evaluation metrics used to evaluate the accuracy of the recommender system models.

- **Experimentation**: This file contains the different experiments performed to obtain the results of the recommender system models.

- **Images**: This file contains the images obtained from evaluation metrics, where have the accuracy of diferents algorithms.

- **Methods version**: This file contains the methods version of the recommender system models. Also its an old version of the algorithms, which are not used in the final version of the recommender system models.

- **`createSmallDataset.py`**: This script creates a small dataset from the original dataset, which is used to test the recommender system models.

- **`datasetAnalysis.py`**: This script analyzes different aspects of the dataset, such as the number of users, items, and ratings.

- **`utils.py`**: This script contains the common functions used in the recommender system models, such as load dataset function, similarity function, TF-IDF, split ataset function, generate genres matrix, and others.<br><br>
