<em>STATE OF THE ART OF RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS</em>

In this project, you could see the differents between the recommender systems algorithms implemented with the collaborative filtering methods or using Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques. The main goal of this project is to compare and analyze the accuracy of these algorithms and find the best one for the given dataset. In addition, a practice related with recommender systems has been extended for a subject of the career.

The projecte is divided into the following sections:

- **Code development**: The code development of the recommender systems algorithms using Python and the libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Pytorchand Scikit-learn. Also, the experimentation codes and results of differents recommender systems models are variable.

- **labcaim_recommeders**: This section contains the necessary part for an universitary practise, such as the documentation, the dataset and the incomplete implementation of the recommender systems algorithms.

- **ml-latest-small**: This section contains the latest small dataset for the recommender systems algorithms. The dataset is extracted from the GroupLens website. Also, two datasets generated from the original dataset are included.

In each section, you could find the indication and explication of the files that contain.
